# Dynarr | Dynamic Array Implementations
dynarr is a project that includes dynamic array implementations. Currently
only for C. But in future, even if dynamic library is implemented in language,
we can implement this in different languages.

## Implementations
* C | [~kurth4cker/libdynarr][]: Implemented most of functions... But still in
  development.
* Hare | [~kurth4cker/hare-dynarr][]: Generally hare is not needed dynamic array
  implementation. It has slices... But for testing hare, this will be implemented.

## Contributing
You can use [~kurth4cker/dynarr-devel][]
mailing list for any development mail and patches.
